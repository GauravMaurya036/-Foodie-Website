# üçî Foodie ‚Äî Responsive Food Ordering Website

A simple, responsive food-ordering front-end built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The project dynamically fetches menu items from **TheMealDB API** and provides interactive cart functionality.

Live Demo: [Foodie Website on Vercel](https://foodie-website-gamma.vercel.app/)

## üîé Overview

This project demonstrates a clean, mobile-first UI for browsing food items and adding them to a cart. The menu cards are **loaded dynamically at runtime** via the TheMealDB API (Indian cuisine). The fetch is implemented in `main.js` (see `initApp()`), which pulls data from:

```
https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?a=Indian
```

If you need an offline or custom-data fallback, you can replace that fetch with a local `product.json` and adjust `initApp()` accordingly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Notes about the API & Offline Mode

* `main.js` uses `fetch()` to get a list of meals from TheMealDB. The app maps those results into `productList` entries with `id`, `name`, `price`, and `image`.
* If you want to use custom data or run the site without internet:

  1. Create a `product.json` file with an array of products (id, name, price, image).
  2. Replace the API `fetch(...)` call in `initApp()` with `fetch('product.json')` (the project already contains a commented example in `main.js`).

Example product item format used in the code:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Double Beef Burger",
  "price": "‚Çπ250",
  "image": "IMG/burger.png"
}
```

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Future Improvements

* Checkout & payment flow
* Admin dashboard to add/edit menu items
* Login & user orders
* Save cart to localStorage or backend
* Search & filter for menu items
* Accessibility improvements and a11y audit
